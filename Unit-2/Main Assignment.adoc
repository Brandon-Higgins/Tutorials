Your main assignment is to make a Tic Tacoma Toe program. You may have the GUI set up in any fashion, as long as the code is functional. For this code you can go two ways

1. You can have a user picked X and a user picked O

2. You can have a user picked X and computer generated O

3. Or you can do both!

You must have a final win condition, but intelligent AI is not necessary.
